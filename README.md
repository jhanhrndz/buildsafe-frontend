# Frontend â€“ BuildSafe

This repository contains the **BuildSafe frontend**, built with **React**, **Vite**, and **TypeScript**.  
Its purpose is to provide a modern and intuitive interface for managing and monitoring the system.  
All interactions are handled through the **backend**, which acts as an intermediary with other services.
